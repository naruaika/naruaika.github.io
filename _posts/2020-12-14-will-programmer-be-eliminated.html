    <i>Why not?</i> As avid listeners to technology news, we certainly know a lot about how artificial intelligence can help humans in various jobs. Indeed, they can replace humans themselves in doing many complicated and even impossible computing jobs. Having heard a lot of news about the success of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov" rel="nofollow">Deep Blue won</a> its first match against world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, people began to think of all sorts. Among their ideas have alluded programming work summarized in several case studies below are interesting to consider if we want to continue to work as a computer programmer in the future.
</p>

<p>
    <b>First,</b> have we written a letter of complaint in resentment when we have mastered algorithms, data structures, object-oriented programming and other key concepts in a perfect way that brings us to the end with an A on every school's exam, but we are too confused when it comes to choosing a programming language needs to be studied in-depth to be able to plunge into the real world? We would not think of learning it all, would we? Everyone has their own style, characteristics, preferences and abilites, forcing him/her to choose a path between the paths leading to the world he/she is interested in, it could be front-end development, back-end, devops, database management and others with with a kind of different platforms. Each company which our application letter and curriculum vitae will be sent to has their respective inclination in choosing a programming language as a job requirement, depending on who they are, what their business goals are, who they do business with, how they do business, et cetera. For example, in back-end development for web platforms, they are several languages worth considering, including Javascript (Node.js), Python (Django), PHP (Laravel), and Java. In which each has so many frameworks that deserve attention.
</p>

<p>
    Have we never thought what if there is a chance to master only one and then an instrument cleverly converts it into the desired one? If it was born into this hard-paced world, did not we merely need to pick up the most preferred or the easiest ones to conquer most of the world's problem? During April fool's day, 2012, you might have been fooled by <i>Transifex</i>&mdash;a profit company engaged in automatic written language translation&mdash;which has announced the successful development of its programming language translator facility <a href="//https:%20//www.transifex.com/blog/2012/translating-between-programming-langs/" rel="nofollow">on their blog</a>, but it will not happen again! Happily, it may eventually become a reality in the next few years since a number of persistent efforts have been made <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/deep-learning-to-translate-between-programming-languages/" rel="nofollow">by our friends</a> at Facebook. It turns out that this kind of idea has been gaining attention for a long time, to be precise about four years ago <a href="https://aircconline.com/ijci/V5N2/5216ijci09.pdf">a study offered</a> a solution for translating pseudo-code into programming language. Therefore, a question <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/12475/why-arent-there-automated-translators-from-one-programming-language-to-another" rel="nofollow"><i>is it possible</i></a> six to ten years ago started to seem irrelevant. What a time to be alive!
</p>

<p>
    <b>Second,</b> for those who are often involved in developing web application user interfaces, usually have experienced a headache when trying to convert a sketch into program code. Too fanciful mockups left us shaking our heads in an unusual way. It is true, even a unique design has the potential to make the company's products more valuable. But who would have thought, being too creative was not always valued as a intelligent initiative. So that in the end, if the manager did not neglect both sides, the project would end up in bad luck. In this case, a leader ought wisely to consider leaning on the creativity of the designer girl or the prowness of the boy programmer.
</p>

<p>
    The above anxiety raises bright ideas in the development of a machine learning model that makes us smile. No, wait, who is supposed to be smiling? Because an innovation from <a href="https://sketch2code.azurewebsites.net/" rel="nofollow">the Microsoft team</a> or <a href="https://fronty.com/" rel="nofollow">the Fronty team</a> capable of transforming any hand-drawn designs into HTML code. So what is the point in paying a programmer again?
</p>

<p>
    <b>Third,</b> thinking of tommorow when programming will only be a historical record is very worrying. Moreover, to date, people start to wonder about the things they saw yesterday in science fiction films. That actually what is a better life? Is that the offices were packed with computers and also robots? So that young people can have fun every day until they turn gray, sipping a cup of robusta every morning, attending festivals during the day, falling asleep at night. While laughing with relatives, let the automatic computers work hard to meet the needs of all human beings in the universe. What else needs to be considered if the robots are capable of making brilliant innovations on their own?
</p>

<p>
    The history of technological development can no longer be predicted and realised. If yesterday, working as a programmer was a trend, maybe tomorrow there will be technology that tore apart the fate of programmers. We are not talking about saga, we are just talking facts. Ah, I do not want to say any more. Look and judge for yourself all the shows built on GPT-3 technology below.
</p>

<p>
    <i>"Here's a sentence describing what Google's home page should look and here's GPT-3 generating the code for it nearly perfectly"</i> (<a href="https://t.co/m49hoKiEpR">pic.twitter.com/m49hoKiEpR</a>). <i>"Wow. I built a React dice component with GPT-3. This feels far more fun than writing JSX"</i> (<a href="https://t.co/kQGd9LvUsV">pic.twitter.com/kQGd9LvUsV</a>). <i>"I built a todo list app simply by describing it to GPT-3. It generated the React code for a fully functioning app within seconds. I&#39;m becoming more impressed and aware of its capabilities every single day"</i> (<a href="https://t.co/QGrClar03s">pic.twitter.com/QGrClar03s</a>).
</p>

<p>
    So, what do you think about the development of various technologies above? Would this be an encouraging report or the opposite?
