    Just another short story ...
</p>

<p>
    I love theme Adwaita theme, especially the dark one. So, I always have it enabled by using GNOME Tweaks. Unfortunately, many applications do not seem to be worked pretty well in dark theme. So, I wanted to know how to run certain Flatpak application in light theme without me changing the global default theme.
</p>

<p>
    In my case, <b>WPS Office</b> has a poor display of the font search dropdown list; black text on dark background will never be good. After googling for a while, I got to know that WPS Office was installed at <code>/var/lib/flatpak/app/com.wps.Office/</code>. It seemed like all Flatpak applications will be installed either at
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>/var/lib/flatpak/app/</code> for system-wide installation; or</li>
    <li><code>~/.local/share/flatpak/app</code> for per-user installation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Exploring the directory structure, I have realised that somehow WPS Office has included its own theme directory at <code>/var/lib/flatpak/app/com.wps.Office/x86_64/stable/active/files/share/themes/</code>.
</p>

<pre class="wrapped">
$ cd /var/lib/flatpak/app/com.wps.Office/x86_64/stable/active/files/share/themes/

$ ls
Adwaita  Adwaita-dark  Default  Emacs  HighContrast  Raleigh
</pre>

<p>
    I think, this is not common, at least not for most applications. Then, I idly experimented to remove the <code>Adwaita-dark</code> folder, so that WPS Office cannot find it anymore. Or at least just to rename it;
</p>

<pre class="wrapped">
$ sudo mv Adwaita-dark/ Adwaita-dark-bk/
$ sudo mv Adwaita/ Adwaita-dark/
</pre>

<p>
    Fortunately, it seemed to be worked. Yay! I have managed to force WPS Office to use the light theme instead! Although I cannot explain it.
</p>

<p>
    <b>For GTK applications,</b> we can make sure to set the GTK_THEME environment variable. For example, for the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gcolor3" rel="nofollow">Color Picker</a> application:
</p>

<pre class="wrapped">
$ sudo flatpak override --env=GTK_THEME=Adwaita nl.hjdskes.gcolor3
</pre>

<p>
    To unset, just need to set the value to empty:
</p>

<pre class="wrapped">
$ sudo flatpak override --env=GTK_THEME= nl.hjdskes.gcolor3
</pre>

<p>
    <b>For Qt applications,</b> set the <code>QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE</code> variable instead.
</p>

<p>
    You deserve a good day, bye!
