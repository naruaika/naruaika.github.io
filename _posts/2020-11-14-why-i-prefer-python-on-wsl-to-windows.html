    The only question is why? Even though it is only a three word question, it needs some explanations. I hate getting people to do things without telling, at least, a reason or two behind them. Most likely, in fact in this post, I just wanted to tell my stories using Python on WSL2.
</p>

<p>
    I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_edge_technology" rel="nofollow">bleeding edge technology</a>, so I have Python 3.9 installed by the time of writing. Of course, I have concerned that not all of my needs can be obtained easily. Notably, I did not get some wheel packages in <a href="https://pypi.org/" rel="nofollow">the PyPI</a> available for this version 3.9. Despite knowing there are lots of great developers on the internet who provided <a href="https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/" rel="nofollow">those wheels</a> unofficially, I just do not want to always rely on them. So, let us look at different scenarios.
</p>

<p>
    Uh, wait, first we need to prepare the tools for building. Since by default, Fedora on WSL2 has brought these tools, we have nothing else to do. On Windows, we need several C++ development tools, i.e. MSVC v142 and Windows 10 SDK, provided by <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Installer</a> as shown below.

<p>
    For my sake, I have created a separated virtual environment only for this experiment on both Fedora and Windows system.

<p>
    At the moment, the <code>scikit-learn</code> developer does not provide the wheel package for Python 3.9 yet, so we are going to build and install our own. The installation can be done simply by <code>pip install scikit-learn</code>. After a while, it has finished on both systems without having to worry at all. To confirm everything is okay, we just need to do a little checking by <code>python -c "import sklearn"</code>. Fedora did not show any output meaning it was running correctly, while Windows has made me feeling blue.
</p>

    By reading the message and going to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3dm3h86" rel="nofollow">the given link</a>, I should realised that I only came to lament. To sit on my knees waiting for uncertainty. It is still being investigated! Maybe we will get a patch updates tomorrow morning, but consider the other things similar can happen after installing the patch. Is this meant by design? I wish no.

<p>
    When trying to install <code>PyAudio</code> for the first time without setting up anything beforehand, we are bound to get an error as shown below.
</p>

<pre class="wrapped">
> pip install PyAudio
...
src/_portaudiomodule.c(29): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'portaudio.h': No such file or directory
    error: command 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.28.29333\\bin\\HostX86\\x64\\cl.exe' failed with exit code 2
...
</pre>

<p>
    Similar errors will be faced at Fedora as well. It appears that an attempt was made to find <code>portaudio.h</code> in the system. On Windows, we can build it manually using one of <a href="http://portaudio.com/docs/v19-doxydocs/tutorial_start.html" rel="nofollow">the three options</a>. But they are kind of painful tasks! So I was not willing to even intend to try it. Meanwhile, as expected, we only need to run a short command on Fedora to bring it home.

<p>
    Is that going to work? Yes, at least it can be imported without any error. But no, for WSL does not support audio, although there is <a href="https://x410.dev/cookbook/wsl/enabling-sound-in-wsl-ubuntu-let-it-sing/" rel="nofollow">a way of</a> making it work.
</p>

<p>
    Anyway, you got the idea! I sincerely hope that <code>winget</code> will take on the same level of benefits of GNU/Linux distribution package manager!

    Why does something on Windows turn out to be so expensive for simple things?

    I have a lot to share, but that is all for now. <i>Shhh</i>, by the way, <i>Guido van Rossum</i> has <a href="https://twitter.com/gvanrossum/status/1326932991566700549" rel="nofollow">decided to join</a> Microsoft! Will Python be able to do any better on Windows?
