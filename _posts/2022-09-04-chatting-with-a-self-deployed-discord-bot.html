    Among friends from the gaming community, I have been known as a NPC lover. Do not get me wrong; I do not like certain NPCs, but rather all NPCs. Why not just hang out with other players instead? I am living in real world, so I am not willing if someone&mdash;let us say a toxic player&mdash;from virtual world could mess up with my life. The excitement of chatting with real humans is priceless indeed. But at some point in time, we only want to have a friend to chat without knowing who we really are. If only the in-game player-to-player chat was truly a sandbox, but that is okay.

    Name a role-playing game that has real dialogue with NPCs. To date, I have not found one. There have been offering to the answer choices or none at all. Moreover, some only provides futile answer choices, not at all changing the story regardless of the choice.

<p>
    I have been introduced to BlenderBot, an open source chatbot developed by Facebook AI Research, by a post from <a href="https://dev.to/edemgold" rel="nofollow">@edemgold</a>. But instead, I am eager to turn it into a Discord bot.

<p>
    Once the application is run by simply executing <code>python main.py</code>, we can basically say anything to the bot. But the best part of it is bringing my own Discord server to life with discussions between bots while I work in the office!
