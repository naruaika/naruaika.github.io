    It's by no means that we should break the rules as some people like to say that <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/rules-are-made-to-be-broken" rel="nofollow"><i>rules are made to be broken</i></a>. Humans are <a href="https://www.psychologs.com/why-are-human-beings-called-social-animals/" rel="nofollow">social animals</a>&mdash;or should we say <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Aristotle/Political-theory" rel="nofollow">political animals</a>&mdash;, they tend to want to be part of a group that shares similar values. Where they meet, interact, and connect with people who can fill each other's gaps, thereby helping them <a href="https://open.ncl.ac.uk/theories/16/social-capital-theory/#:~:text=material advantages gained by individuals who participate in various social networks" rel="nofollow">achieve certain values</a> in life.
</p>

<p>
    At the same time, people <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241065845_Optimal_Distinctiveness_Theory/#:~:text=individuals have two fundamental and competing human needs" rel="nofollow">also want to</a> be easily recognized among the crowd, to be able to express themselves, and live their own lives carrying an identity as an individual. As long as it doesn't exclude them from the groups they like to be in, they'll continue to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255858189_Identifiable_but_Not_Identical_Combining_Social_Identity_and_Uniqueness_Motives_in_Choice/#:~:text=Higher needs for uniqueness lead consumers to differentiate within groups" rel="nofollow">search for something</a> by which can reflects their behavior, style, and personal narratives more accurately.
</p>

<p>
    Today we no longer group people only by demographics, but rather classify them by <a href="https://instapage.com/blog/psychographic-segmentation/" rel="nofollow">the values they hold</a>. This has blurred the lines of uniqueness and exclusivity more than ever, leading us to conclude that humans aren't completely unique, in the sense that there isn't any single attribute inherent in them that no one else has. Some attributes will place them <a href="https://oxford-review.com/the-oxford-review-dei-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-dictionary/intersectionality-theory-definition-and-explanation/#:~:text=lives and experiences are shaped by a matrix of social categories that interact in ways that cannot be separated" rel="nofollow">in one group</a>, while others will fall into another.
</p>

<p>
    It doesn't matter anymore whether we're unique or not. Rules in certain condition are no longer relevant. What is more important is to show others the values we uphold; values that can relate to a group of people. By introducing to some web designs that might inspire you, this series of articles aims to help you become more accurate in expressing your brand according to its target consumers.

    The five examples above illustrate how simple it is to break the web layout. Almost all the examples in this article use the same technique, yet we'll see how just playing with these few attributes can give a different character out of most websites.
</p>

<h2 id="grid-layout">
    Grid Layout
</h2>

<p>
    When discussing web layouts, it's worth revisiting the old days when news media websites like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/" rel="nofollow"><i>The New York Times</i></a> struggled to organize information on their homepages. So, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001216165100/http://www.nytimes.com/" rel="nofollow">they took</a> the only realistic approach which required abusing the table layout. To break up the layout to make it as appealing as physical newspaper, they literaly placed tables inside a table recursively and set the table data cells to different widths. Since we always have <code>colspan</code> and <code>rowspan</code>, so sometimes we prefer them rather than creating separate tables. To accommodate the responsive design needs, news media websites moves to using flexbox so that the columns can wrap automatically when the screen width is less than a certain size.
</p>

<figure>
    <div class="container">
        <picture>
            <img src="/assets/posts/a65336e656766782e042.webp" alt="">
        </picture>
    </div>
    <figcaption>
        <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/" rel="nofollow">Cable News Network (CNN)</a> website is among the news websites with the highest information density while maintaining a clear visual hierarchy. If they used grid layouts&mdash;like <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/world/" rel="nofollow">The Atlantic</a>&mdash;instead of flexboxes as they're doing now, the density wouldn't be as high.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    Depends on the type of business of the client you're working with or a potential business you're thinking of, this layout may be the only one you need after all. But hey, maybe we just want a table layout anyway. Well, even in this modern age, people still use tables to create sophisticated designs.
</p>

<figure>
    <div class="container">
        <picture>

    </div>
    <figcaption>
        Try to inspect the <a href="https://mosaicco.com/" rel="nofollow">Mosaic</a> homepage yourself to see that they really use some <code>table</code> elements to layout their pages.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    If we want each item to be evenly sized and distributed, look no further than a grid layout. Or a combination of the two as on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/" rel="nofollow"><i>The New York Times</i></a> website.
</p>

        <a href="https://www.thenorthface.com/en-us" rel="nofollow">The North Face</a> uses a grid layout that's anything but simple which adds another layer of satisfaction. Guess what, they use 12 rows and 13 columns to achieve this depth.

    It's not that boring, isn't it? Since we all love photo collages. This kind of layout is also known as <a href="https://www.obergine.com/news-and-blog/2024/july-2024/a-design-trend-bento-grids" rel="nofollow">a bento grid</a> which we often see in every latest Apple WWDC.

<p>
    Want something more organic? I heard someone call it a deliberate random layout design&mdash;sorry if that sounds weird as it's being translated to English.

<p>
    Give yourself a chance with this layout as it gets less complicated to look and implement:
</p>

<figure>
    <div class="container">

        Can you recall anything? Exactly, <a href="https://www.lidrs.nl/" rel="nofollow">LiDRS</a>, <a href="https://www.braze.com/" rel="nofollow">Braze</a>, and <a href="https://kaplan.com/" rel="nofollow">Kaplan</a> use a simple transformation for each card to reach this layout design.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    What if we only want to adjust either the image or the content of each card? Let's see below.
</p>

<figure>
    <div class="container">
        <picture>
            <img src="/assets/posts/ab9b95991f507c2a43b7.webp" alt="">

<p>
    A final example that might make the layout looks breaking is by creating the subtle illusion that the cards aren't aligned with each other on the vertical axis, when in fact we're simply using a technique we learned in <a href="/post/non-rectangular-images-in-web-design">the previous article</a>.

        The easiest example we can find is <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> as they <a href="https://www.versionmuseum.com/history-of/wikipedia-website" rel="nofollow">have been consistently</a> doing the layout since 2004.

        Another good example is <a href="https://www.nestle.com/" rel="nofollow">Nestle</a> website when accessed through desktop, in contrast to <a href="https://www.unilever.com/" rel="nofollow">Unilever's</a> where it becomes clearly visible on a tablet screen, but not on either of them on a mobile screen size which still makes sense.

    Nowadays, the majority of website layouts are far too simple, especially since the emergence of flexbox and grid layouts in major browsers. Or maybe since the rise of the mobile-first design philosophy which seems <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mobile-first-not-mobile-only/" rel="nofollow">to be misunderstood</a> by some people. Anyway, I still have some faiths that this particular layout is and will still be used by large established companies, but just not by media companies like <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/" rel="nofollow"><i>The New Yorker</i></a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/" rel="nofollow"><i>The Atlantic</i></a>, and <a href="https://www.economist.com/" rel="nofollow"><i>The Economist</i></a>.

    I can relate though when many people complain about <a href="https://blog.pixelfreestudio.com/the-trouble-with-css-float-modern-alternatives-you-should-use/" rel="nofollow">the unpredictable behavior</a> caused by the <code>float</code> attribute. Ultimately, the feature makes a layout more attractive, as well as increasing the density of information. Use when appropriate, but with caution.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/shape-outside#browser_compatibility" rel="nofollow">In 2014</a>, after the flexbox was widely introduced, the <code>shape-outside</code> attribute gracefully arrived in <i>Google Chrome</i>. This takes the use of <code>float</code> attribute to the next level. It opens up new ideas for creating non-rectangular images in a design approach <a href="/post/non-rectangular-images-in-web-design">as previously discussed</a>.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://chromestatus.com/metrics/css/timeline/popularity/347" rel="nofollow">It's reported</a> that as of today, less than 2% of page loads in <i>Chrome</i> have adopted this new feature. Sadly, the effect of the <code>shape-outside</code> attribute doesn't necessarily visible anywhere on the pages; it simply tells us that the CSS code on the pages contains that feature, possibly due to the use of a CSS framework which may be poorly optimized or not at all.

    Since I'm unable to find any real uses for this, let's make our own. I may update this once I find one.
